    <p class="txt"><i><b>Iceland</i></b> is a country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and
    and ice co-exist. Where dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun. A country
    where insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture. </p>

      <div class="p1">
      <p> The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddes of dawn,
      Aurora, and the <br> Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. From september to april, Iceland is a hotspot for this <br>
      magnificient lightshow. <br>
      The Aurora Borealus, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a natural <br>
      phenomenon created when particles entitled by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the <br> Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy, causing
      peculiar luminous green streaks across <br> the skies.

      When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's <br>
      namesake - namely, its 4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is <br>
      practiced year-round and takes place mainly on the Solheimajokull and Svinafellsjokukll <br>
      glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavik (and <br>
      Skaftafell).
